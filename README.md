# BrainWaves
BrainWaves Machine Learning Hackathon is a pan India competetion hosted on HackerEarth : https://www.hackerearth.com/brainwaves/


Societe Generale Global Solution Centre (SG GSC) hosted the third edition of its annual hackathon, Brainwaves. The event was aimed at bringing together some of the brightest minds together for a 30-hour build session. The theme for the event was “Machine Learning.” 


Even though it was a week long competetion, I got to know about it in the very end. Within investement of around 1 hour I was able to secure a top 4% finish in the final standings and qualied for the final round at SG GSC.

The pronlem statement was broken into two parts.

1. Supervised Machine Learning problem : To predict whther the stocks in the test set will go up or down based on the observations given in train set. For this part, I tried GBM and XGBoost models.

2. Unsupervised Machine Learning problem : Clustering the 100 masked independent variables into groups so that each cluster contains simmilar variables. For this part, I used hierarchial clustering.
